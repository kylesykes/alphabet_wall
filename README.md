# Stranger Things Alphabet Wall

This is a repo to store all the arduino files I use to program my Arduino alphabet wall.  I built this for my wife's murder mystery business.  It stays fully lit up initially but after a set interval of time it flashes all the lights, then spells out a clue for the guests, then goes back to fully lit up.
